<h3>What is the COD.GS War Room?</h3>
<p>This is a third party tool that aims to supplement the Call of Duty app with more control and advanced features that is aimed at the more advanced Clan owner. In addition to providing app features in a more neutral web setting, there are
advanced Clan Wars tracking tools such as net node changes, roster tracking, and more that the app does not provide.</p>

<p>This tool is a personal project of mine that aims to "fill in the gaps" concerning Clan Wars and provide a more enriching and involving experience.</p>

<p>If you've been given access to this tool at this stage, you will experience the development of this tool as it progresses, and potentially shape it's direction. This tool is still very early and not fully developed. Problems and bugs are to be expected. In addition, new features are constantly being added.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping me test this service. - <a href="http://twitter.com/zpunl">@ZPUNl</a><p>

This is a third party application developed independently.

<h4>Can I share this link/app with people?</h4>
NO. Access here is a privilege granted to you and you alone. The service is not ready for any public use and must not be shared or talked about at this time. Any unauthorized leaks will result in your clan's access removed.

<h4>Can I get my friend's clan tracked in this?</h4>
The selection of clans currently included in this test is limited. Testing will open up to more clans later down the road.

<h4>I saw/found a problem or a bug! wat do?</h4>
Make note of it and let me know about it. Bugs are to be expected.

<h4>How often does the data refresh. Do I need to keep refreshing the page?</h4>
Clan Wars scorecard data is refreshed every 30 seconds as per the app standard. The roster tracker updates approximately every 10 minutes. The page will autorefresh at this interval so no manual reload is necessary.
